Notes:
    - Human pilot: using mobile phone AR Drone app to directly control quadcopter to fly through the entire course
    - Auto pilot:
    - Auto target: not for this year since human pilot to fly the quadcopter
    - Image process: not for this year since human pilot to fly the quadcopter
    - Battery power:
      . consider using cell phone batteries and should be good enough for flying through 100x600 feet course
      . battery connection: use voltage booster
    - Harris highly recommends items or things:
      . Computer simulation: we may do several ones(Simscape blockset, Control communiocation, Navigation algorithm)
      . Expertise in all area: not need all of them since first year not focusing at Mechanical, 3D design, signal process and communication, control system, propagation, HMI software
      . Enhancements: Custom rotors to enhance maneuvering and pattern recognition
    - Source control suggestions:
      . Github: source control
      . Trello: project management
      
To do:
    - Items to sign out HTC lab 5-320: 2xBBB
    - Wish list:
      . Ultrasound sensors
      . Infrared sensors
      . Compass sensors
      . voltage level shifter
      . Voltage regulators for 1.8v for the voltage shifter
